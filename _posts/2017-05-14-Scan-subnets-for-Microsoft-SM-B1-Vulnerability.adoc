I found a great tool for checking if a Windows machine is vulnerable to the Eternalblue / MS17-010 exploit by https://github.com/RiskSense-Ops/MS17-010[RiskSense] earlier on.

The tool is great, however it only checks a single IP address, so I forked and made a quick modification so it will scan entire subnets, expressed in CIDR notation.  You can get it here:
